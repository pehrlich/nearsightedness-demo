Ideas:

Festival:

 - Puff up each furniture, turn it in to a balloon
 - get rid of the room, make them all balloons in the wind held by a litle girl
 - click on them and she lets them go (or they get cut)
 - release all of them, and it zooms out to show a thought bubble in the chair
 
 
Discussion:
 
 - Start the scene, and you see vague clock hands in front of your vision.  You can't quite tell what they are  
 - When you click on a chair, the camera moves in to it, and you become the piece of furniture
 - you look around, and see that you were originally a grand father clock
 - remove the floor and have everything float on a cloud
 - remove the ceiing and have evereything in the stars
 - add a Bokeh filter
